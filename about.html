                    <p>
                        The company has been founded early in 2017. In the goal to help the Mauritian people to get good 3D printing service. Seeing foreign people achieving their goals and making great things, we decided to give our people the opportunity to do the same.
                    </p>
                    <h2> 3D printing technology </h2>
                    <p class="dark">
                        One of the greatest things about 3D printing is that it can be beneficial for anyone, regardless of industry or profession. 
                        This technology allows ideas to develop faster than ever. Being able to 3D print a concept the same day it was designed shrinks a development process from what might have been months to a matter of days.
                        It will also help to figure out the errors in the concept/design before completetion of the final product.
